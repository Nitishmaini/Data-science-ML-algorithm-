Case study on different ML algorithm data science point of view 
problem statement
A crash test is a form of destructive testing that is preffered in order to ensure high safety standards for various cars
sevral cars have rolled into on independent audit unit for crash test.
They are being evaluated on a defined scale {poor(-10) to excellent(10)} on 
1) Mainkin Head impact
2) Mainkin body impact
3) Interior Impact
4) HVAC impact
5) safety alarm system

Each of the crash test is very expensive so company performed test on only 100 cars
Type of car:- Hatchback/SUV, was noted.
However with this data infuture they should be able to predict the type of car
# Part of data is reserved for building(Train) a model and remaining kept of analysis(test)
# Data for 80 cars is given in crashTest_1.csv
# Data for 20 cars is given in crashTest_1_Test.csv
# use logistic regression classification technique to classify the car type hatchback/SUV
